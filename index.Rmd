#For the project, our area of focus is centered on highlighting the disparities
#in access to voting within marginalized communities. Specifically, our target 
#groups are women and the BIPOC community and any intersectionality between the
#two demographics. We are interested in this as we all feel that issues such as
#voter suppression and voter intimidation are still increasingly pervasive 
#systemic issues that have led to a lack in voter engagement and turnout within
#these groups. There are a multitude of existing and new barriers, such as 
#delay with ballot drop-offs via US Postal Service, continual cut of mail 
#ballot drop-off sites, lack of online registration, personal identification 
#requirements and more. With that, our group aims to dive more in-depth into 
#this study to observe where these practices are still prevalent, analyze the 
#number of people it still affects, as well as understand the effects of it on 
#todayâ€™s voting processes. Our dataset is taken from the U.S. Census Bureau 
#and displays the voting information separated by race and gender. This 
#accumulation of information allows us to analyze any disparities or trends 
#in voting data within our target marginalized communities.
