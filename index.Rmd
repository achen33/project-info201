## Introduction
For the project, our area of focus is centered on highlighting the disparities
in access to voting within marginalized communities. Specifically, our target 
groups are women and the BIPOC community and any intersectionality between the
two demographics. We are interested in this as we all feel that issues such as
voter suppression and voter intimidation are still increasingly pervasive 
systemic issues that have led to a lack in voter engagement and turnout within
these groups. There are a multitude of existing and new barriers, such as 
delay with ballot drop-offs via US Postal Service, continual cut of mail 
ballot drop-off sites, lack of online registration, personal identification 
requirements and more. With that, our group aims to dive more in-depth into 
this study to observe where these practices are still prevalent, analyze the 
number of people it still affects, as well as understand the effects of it on 
todayâ€™s voting processes. Our data set is taken from the U.S. Census Bureau 
and displays the voting information separated by race and gender. This 
accumulation of information allows us to analyze any disparities or trends 
in voting data within our target marginalized communities.

# summary information function 
For the summary information, we decides to focus on these specific areas: 
Minimum and maximum percentage of racial groups that registered to vote,
minimum and maximum percentage of racial groups that voted during the 2016 
President Election, as well as the ratio comparing women voters to total U.S.
population voters and BIPOC voters to total U.S. population voters.

##chart 1
'''{r chartOne, echo = FALSE, message =  FALSE}

##chart 2
'''{r chartTwo, echo = FALSE, message =  FALSE}
'''
This histogram chart was intended to show the relationship between the number 
of white individuals who registered and the number of white individuals who 
voted. The data from this graph then allows us to compare the differences 
between races in order to asses whether or not there is a significant disparity
between access to voting even after being registered between race groups.

##chart 3
'''{r chartThree, echo = FALSE, message =  FALSE}
'''
These pie charts were created with the intentions of visualizing the relationship
between the number of BIPOC individuals who registered to vote versus the
number of BIPOC individuals who voted within the U.S. 2016 Presidential 
Election. Similar to the other two charts, while this chart highlights a
different demographic, it will allow us to compare the statistics 
of voter registration between different genders and race groups to observe any
possible disparities.
